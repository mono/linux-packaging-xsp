mono-apache-server2 for Debian
--------------------------

mod-mono-server2 is a backend server2 that allows you to run ASP.NET web
applications in conjunction with Apache and the mod_mono Apache module. 
In Debian, mod-mono-server2 is provided in the package mono-apache-server2.

mod-mono-server2 creates a socket in /tmp, and mod_mono communicates with
mod-mono-server2 through that socket. Apache will pass the HTTP request via
mod_mono to mod-mono-server2, and mod-mono-server2 will pass the result back
to Apache via mod_mono.

So you need this package to run mod_mono, and vice versa.

When mod_mono is installed, it will create a link to
/etc/mono-server2/mono-server2-hosts.conf. This file contains the configuration
for mod_mono. Among other things, it makes sure that aspx pages are handled
by mono_mono, and it defines all your ASP.NET web applications and the mappings
between URIs and the file system.

However, you should NOT EDIT THIS FILE by hand. Instead, you can manage the
mono-server2-hosts.conf file with the administration scripts provided by
mod-mono-server2. The administration scripts work on a directory structure in
/etc/mono-server2 -- this is what it looks like:

/etc/mono-server2                <- The root of the configuration structure
/etc/mono-server2/conf.d         <- VirtualHosts Config Directories
/etc/mono-server2/conf.d/monodoc <- MonoDoc Config Files

To create an ASP.NET virtual host, you create a new directory under conf.d,
such as the monodoc example above. Then, you place configuration files for
that virtual host in the directory. Every file is marked by a number, an
underscore, and the alias name for that ASP.NET application. For example:

/etc/mono-server2/conf.d/monodoc/10_monodochttp

You then need to run mono-server2-update, which will read the directory
structure and rebuild the mono-server2-hosts.conf file. mod-mono-server2 will
automatically detect the changes in the file, and adjust its configuration
accordingly. The mono-server2-update script will also create a
debian.webapp file, which is needed for the ASP.NET applications.

Packages that wish to install ASP.NET web applications can just follow the
above procedure. If mod-mono-server2 is running, the application will be
automatically activated.

You don't need to start mod-mono-server2. If it's not running when a request
comes in, mod_mono will start it (unless you have disabled mod_mono). Note
that mono-server2-update can start Apache.

Happy Hacking!
